# Book Search Engine with Apollo Server

Understanding the machiniations of the MERN stack in this age of web development is crucial to understanding how clients would effectively interface with a practical webpage. For this reason, My task this week is take an existing application dedicated as a search engine for books, then refactoring it to utilize GraphQL as an API, built with Apollo. Please take the time to look over the code as it pertains to the exchange of data from client to server using these processes.
